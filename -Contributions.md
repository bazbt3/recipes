## Formatting    
(The only help you'll need if you're here - aside from choosing representative filenames, using an .md suffix, and using Github-flavoured Markdown throughout.

Please use the following 'style' throughout, e.g. - copy the text below then paste into your new file:

```
## Edible thing name (with 4 trailing spaces!)        
(A short description.)
 
### Ingredients:

* first,
* second,
* third\*,
* 94th.\**
    

### Preparation:
 
1. first thing to do,
2. second,
3. third,
4. Enjoy.

---- 

\* Escaped footnote 1.
\** Escaped footnote 2.
```

Note: Footnotes should be avoided if at all possible.
