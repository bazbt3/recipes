## Cheesy pork pie    
(A hot pork pie topped with cheese, optional black pudding.)

### Ingredients:

* A 2-3" (5-7.5cm) diameter pork pie - those with the side crust rim raised slightly above the top crust work best,
* Lancashire/Cheshire (crumbly white) cheese,
* A 1/8" (0.3cm) thin slice of black pudding (optional.)

### Preparation:

1. If you chose black pudding, place aLthat thin slice centrally on top of the pie,
2. Crumble the crumbly cheese over the top crust of the pie, but not too thickly,
3. Place onto a microwave proof plate and microwave for 60 seconds, or stop once the cheese is melted.
4. Enjoy, remembering just-microwaved things are *hot*!
