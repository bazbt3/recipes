## Recipes

A tiny selection of easy- and quick-to-assemble recipes, with easy-to-find ingredients. 

Food. That's it.

Don't expect the mainstream to intrude here.

This is primarily a test to see how well github could be used for recipes.

> As-of 2015-12-12 the 'master' branch is a flat listing whereas this 'Categories' branch is loosely-arranged by type-of-food or preparation  categories - and quite a way from being current.
