This is primarily a test to see how well github could be used for recipes.

**2015-12-19:**
* 'Categories_1.0' branch added, building on 'Categories' folder idea but adding README.md files in each folder and links to the recipe files from each.
* Intended to become 'master' in due course.

**2015-12-12:**    
* 'master' branch: a flat listing, whereas the
* 'Categories' branch is loosely-arranged by type-of-food.
