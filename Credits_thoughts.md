**What:**

This is primarily a test to see whether github could be used for recipes.

My first reaction in this age of hyperlinking and wikis is, well, not really.  The github file structure and lack of both search and an easy means to add mainstream-conventional tags means it'll be difficult to find recipes containing a specific ingredient.  Thus this repo will have limited mainstream appeal.

Incidentally, my personal wiki site currently has only one possible user - me. Otherwise I'd attempt something similar there.
