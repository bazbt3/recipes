# Fried egg sandwiches

## Fried egg, toast.

Generally toasted. Yolk runny or hard. Salt and pepper are nice. Pretty simple.

## Fried egg, cheddar, mustard, toast.

Dijon mustard is nice. Honey cup mustard might work too. 

## Fried egg, fried onions, cheddar, mustard, toast.

Fry the onions then crack an egg on top. House smells of onions. Next time maybe lettuce too.
